# Apartment Hunting

In 2021, my team and I won a data visualization competition with over 400 participating teams (Data Arcade Tournament organised by Govtech Singapore). Our submission explored a new way to search for apartments, focusing on accessibility of amenities as the primary search criteria.Â You can view our submission, a Tableau Data Story [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sharon.george/viz/TransformingtheWayWeSearchforFlats/Final). A static version is also included in this repository (PDF of Data Story.pdf).

This repository hosts the Python code I used to prepare the data before importing it into Tableau. This involved various geospatial analysis techniques, which you can read about in my [blog article](https://medium.com/@sharong804.sg/an-immersive-introduction-to-geospatial-analytics-6c4d484e775e). I have also included the datasets used wherever possible (some datasets had licenses which do not allow redistribution), and the Tableau Workbook used.

Happy coding!
